## `rails-tools`

Skills and agents for AFAL Rails applications using Hotwire, Bali ViewComponents, Pundit, and the AFAL stack.

### Agents

#### `dhh-code-reviewer`
Elite code reviewer channeling DHH's standards for Rails craftsmanship. Reviews Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, Stimulus, and ViewComponent code. Used by `/architecture` and `/omc-rails-autopilot` for iterative review passes. Gives a "Rails-worthy" or "needs changes" verdict.

#### `rails-architect`
Feature architecture specialist that generates comprehensive specs (models, controllers, views, tests). Produces deliberately over-engineered first drafts that get refined through DHH review iterations.

### Skills

#### `/architecture`
Generates refined architecture specifications through iterative DHH review. Invokes the `rails-architect` agent to produce a comprehensive spec, then the `dhh-code-reviewer` agent to refine it over 3 iterations. Output: a Rails-worthy spec ready for implementation.

#### `/implement`
Structured implementation from an approved architecture spec. Creates a todo list from the spec, implements step-by-step with tests after each change, runs full verification (tests, rubocop, brakeman), and gets a DHH code review before finalization.

#### `/dhh-review`
Code review against DHH/37signals standards. Accepts a file, directory, glob, `--staged`, or `--branch`. Runs automated checks (Rubocop, Brakeman), invokes the `dhh-code-reviewer` agent, and produces a structured report with severity levels and actionable fixes.

#### `/omc-rails-autopilot`
Autonomous development workflow for Rails applications following AFAL conventions. Fetches user stories from SmartSuite, implements features following Rails/Hotwire/Bali patterns, runs tests, and creates PRs.

#### `/bali-components`
Reference guide for Bali ViewComponents library. Provides accurate API documentation for forms, cards, modals, drawers, lists, and other UI components used in AFAL applications.

#### `/bali-view-audit`
Audits view files for Bali component usage. Identifies missing components, incorrect patterns, and opportunities to use Bali instead of raw HTML.

#### `/pundit-authorization`
Multi-tenant Pundit authorization patterns for AFAL apps. Covers OwnedByOrganization scoping, policy classes, role-based access, controller integration, and testing with Minitest fixtures.

#### `/hotwire-patterns`
Decision guide and implementation patterns for Turbo Drive, Frames, Streams, and Stimulus in AFAL apps. Includes when to use each tool, Bali integration, and common anti-patterns.

#### `/afal-auth`
OmniAuth-based authentication with AFAL IdP. Covers the complete auth flow, session management, route protection, multi-tenancy, and test helpers. Prevents suggesting Devise or local passwords.

#### `/solid-stack`
Database-backed infrastructure with Solid Queue, Solid Cache, and Solid Cable (Rails 8.1). Covers job processing, caching strategies, WebSocket channels, and deployment considerations.

#### `/turbo-mount-react`
React islands architecture via the turbo-mount gem. Covers when to use React vs Hotwire, component mounting, props serialization, Turbo Stream compatibility, and cross-island communication.

#### `/api-endpoints`
RESTful API development with Blueprinter serialization. Covers response structure, controller patterns, composable blueprint views, Pagy pagination, Ransack filtering, and testing API endpoints.

#### `/afal-concerns`
Catalog of reusable Rails model concerns (OwnedByOrganization, Evidenceable, Auditable, Archivable, etc.). Covers composition patterns and when to create new concerns.

#### `/rails-migration-safety`
Zero-downtime database migration patterns. Covers safe column operations, multi-deploy rename/type-change processes, data migrations, rollback strategies, and strong_migrations integration.

#### `/rails-conventions`
DHH-style Rails conventions enforcement for code reviews. Covers controller/model/view patterns, common anti-patterns, and a review checklist aligned with the Rails Doctrine.

---

## `data-tools`

Skills for AFAL data engineering projects using the Fivetran Connector SDK.

### Skills

#### `/fivetran-custom-connector`
Patterns for AFAL's Fivetran custom SDK connectors (FOCALTEC, WMS, GEOTAB). Covers entity configuration in `afalConfiguration.py`, incremental and offset-based sync strategies, schema management, null value handling, and the `load_connector` fixture testing pattern.

---

## `oracle-tools`

Skills for the oracle-gateway project: a JRuby Rails app that integrates with Oracle E-Business Suite.

### Skills

#### `/ebs-expert`
Oracle EBS domain expertise for querying EBS tables, calling PL/SQL APIs, and writing to interface tables. Covers the APPS schema convention, multi-org setup with MO_GLOBAL, FND_GLOBAL session initialization, the interface-table-then-API write pattern, effective dating, and module-specific tables (INV, BOM, WIP, LCM, PO, RCV, AP).

#### `/oracle-jruby`
JRuby + oracle_enhanced technical patterns for Oracle database connectivity. Covers Oracle::Base model setup, raw SQL with bind variables, Oracle DATE type handling, NLS string semantics, CLOB management, JDBC connection pool tuning, and oracle_enhanced adapter gotchas.

---

## `docs-tools`

Skills for adding and maintaining Astro Starlight documentation sites in AFAL Rails applications.

### Skills

#### `/add-docs-site`
Scaffolds an Astro Starlight documentation site inside a Rails application. Covers the full setup: `docs/` directory structure, `astro.config.mjs`, AFAL brand CSS, content pages sourced from actual code, `.gitignore`, Dockerfile build stage integration, `Procfile.dev` dev server, GitHub Actions CI, and the project-local `/update-docs` command. Builds to `public/docs/` (static HTML served by Thruster — zero Rails config changes).

#### `/update-docs`
Updates the Astro Starlight documentation site to reflect recent code changes. Detects changed files via git, maps code areas to doc files (using a project-local mapping if available), reads actual source for accuracy, and updates or creates MDX pages in Spanish. Verifies with `bun run build` before finishing.

#### `/docs-audit`
Identifies undocumented areas by comparing the Rails codebase to the existing docs site. Runs a script to inventory controllers, models, and routes, then cross-references with existing MDX pages to produce a prioritized gap report. Classifies gaps by business impact (end-user features first) and suggests which to address first.

#### `/docs-review`
Quality review of the existing documentation site. Checks each page for accuracy against the current source code, audience appropriateness (end-user vs. technical), MDX validity, and sidebar structure. Produces a report grouped by severity (critical, important, minor) and fixes or proposes fixes.
